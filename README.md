# CounterAppJava

This is my personal project that I made using Java for my friend group. The idea of the project was to create a simple counter app that works by using hotkeys assingned on SteamDeck to increase or decrease number points shown on the counter. The problem when creating this app with Java was that I needed the app to work on background while unfocused so I could use the hotkeys while in game. I used a library called jNativeHook to make my keyEvents nativeKeyEvents that work on background while the app is unfocused.
